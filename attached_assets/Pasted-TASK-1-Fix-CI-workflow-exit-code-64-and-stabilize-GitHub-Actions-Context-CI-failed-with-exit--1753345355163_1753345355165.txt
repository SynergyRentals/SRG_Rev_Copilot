TASK 1: Fix CI workflow (exit code 64) and stabilize GitHub Actions

Context:
- CI failed with exit code 64. Logs show the step:
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      run: uv python install ${{ matrix.python-version }}
  That command is invalid for uv and caused the failure.
- We’re using uv but we can let GitHub Actions install Python with actions/setup-python and then use uv (or plain pip) for deps.
- Tests pass locally (33 passed, 22 skipped for now). We just need CI green.

What to do:

1. Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   - Remove/replace the `uv python install` step.
   - Use:
     ```yaml
     - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
       uses: actions/setup-python@v5
       with:
         python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
         cache: 'pip'
     ```
   - Keep uv if we need it:
     ```yaml
     - name: Install uv
       uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v2
       with:
         version: "latest"
     ```
   - Install deps with ONE method. Prefer uv:
     ```yaml
     - name: Install dependencies
       run: |
         uv pip install -e .
         uv pip install pytest pytest-cov pre-commit requests-mock
     ```
     (or, if simpler, skip uv entirely and just `pip install`.)

   - Run tests:
     ```yaml
     - name: Run tests
       run: pytest -q
     ```

   - Optionally run pre-commit (if hooks work in CI):
     ```yaml
     - name: Run pre-commit
       run: pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure
     ```

2. Make sure the job fails loudly on test errors, not on mis-used commands.
   - Use `set -euo pipefail` if you add multi-line bash sections.

3. Secrets
   - If any step needs Wheelhouse/OpenAI secrets, guard it or skip in CI if missing. Otherwise, just run tests that don’t need live API.

Deliverables:
- List of files changed (especially `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) with a short summary of edits.
- Final YAML snippet of the workflow.
- Exact shell commands I need to run locally (git add/commit/push).
- Screenshot or copy of a successful `pytest -q` run from CI (paste the last few lines).

Acceptance Criteria:
- GitHub Actions run completes successfully (green check).
- No exit code 64. The offending command is gone.
- Tests run and pass/skips are acceptable for now.
- Pre-commit either passes or is documented as skipped.

Return:
1. Changed files summary
2. Updated CI YAML section
3. Commands to commit & push
4. Proof of green CI run (log excerpt)

Begin.
